# Scrapping-api_project
Using Api, web scrapping and CSV I created a Data Base of games that have won an award with their respective global sales. 

The first steps of this project consisted in scrapping all tables from 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_of_the_Year_awards'

After that, got a csv from https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings which had data updated until 2016.

Following step was to update the last CSV until today with this API: https://api.rawg.io/api/games.

Last, merged everything and got the complete and cleaned data base
